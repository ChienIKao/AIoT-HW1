# CRISP-DM for Simple Linear Regression

## 1. Business Understanding
The goal of this project is to create a simple linear regression model that allows users to:
- Modify the slope (`a`) in the equation `y = ax + b`.
- Add noise to the data.
- Specify the number of data points.

This will be implemented as a web application using Streamlit or Flask, following the CRISP-DM methodology.

## 2. Data Understanding
We will generate synthetic data based on the user-defined parameters:
- `a`: Slope of the line.
- `b`: Intercept (default to 0).
- Noise: Random noise added to the data.
- Number of points: Total data points to generate.

## 3. Data Preparation
The data will be generated programmatically using Python. The generated dataset will include:
- `x`: Independent variable.
- `y`: Dependent variable calculated as `y = ax + b + noise`.

## 4. Modeling
We will use the `scikit-learn` library to fit a simple linear regression model to the generated data.

## 5. Evaluation
The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²).

## 6. Deployment
The application will be deployed as a web service, allowing users to interact with the model and visualize the results.

## Next Steps
1. Implement data generation and modeling in Python.
2. Create a web interface for user interaction.
3. Deploy the application.
